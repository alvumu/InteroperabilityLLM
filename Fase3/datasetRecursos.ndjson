{"resource": "Encounter", "description": "The Encounter resource represents the diverse patient interactions within a healthcare setting, encompassing ambulatory, emergency, home health, inpatient, and virtual encounters. This resource covers the complete lifecycle of these interactions, from pre-admission through the actual encounter (for ambulatory visits) to admission, stay, and discharge (for inpatient visits). During an encounter, patients may move between different practitioners and locations, and due to its broad scope, not all elements will be relevant in every setting. To manage this variability, admission and discharge-related information is maintained in a separate admission component within the Encounter resource. The class element distinguishes between settings, guiding the application of business rules and validation processes. There is substantial variability in how different organizations and jurisdictions determine the start of a new encounter and the level of aggregation used. For instance, some organizations may treat each practitioner visit during a hospitalization as a separate encounter, while others may aggregate all visits into a single encounter for the entire admission. Encounters can also be grouped or aggregated under other encounters using the partOf element. This resource can include pre-admission information, with planned encounters reflected by setting the status element to 'planned'. The admission component stores extended information related to an admission event, covering the same period as the encounter itself. If the periods differ, another encounter instance should be used and linked using the partOf element. In terms of relationship to procedures, the Procedure and Encounter resources reference each other. Procedure.encounter refers to procedures performed during the encounter, while Encounter.reason refers to encounters resulting from another procedure, such as a follow-up encounter. The Encounter resource is crucial for documenting and managing the various admissions and movements of patients within healthcare settings, ensuring comprehensive and organized patient care.

{"resource": "PractitionerRole", "description": "The PractitionerRole describes the types of services that practitioners provide for an organization at specific location(s). The PractitionerRole resource can be used in multiple contexts including: Provider Registries where it indicates what a practitioner can perform for an organization (may indicate multiple healthcareservices, locations, and roles) In a Clinical system where it indicates the role, healthcareservice and location details associated with a practitioner that are applicable to the healthcare event (e.g. Observation, Appointment, Condition, CarePlan) In a Clinical system as a point of reference rather than an event, such as a patient's preferred general practitioner (at a specific clinic) The role, specialty, Location telecom and HealthcareService properties can be repeated if required in other instances of the PractitionerRole. Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for representing this data. Where availability, telecom, or other details are not the same across all healthcareservices, or locations a separate PractitionerRole instance should be created. Many resource types have a choice of a reference to either a Practitioner resource or a PractitionerRole resource. The latter provides organizational context for the practitioners participation when it is required, otherwise a direct reference to the practitioner may be used. Many implementations may choose to profile the PractitionerRole to a single location/role/healthcareservice for their specific usage. As the property that references a PractitionerRole typically has a specific context, the code on the PractitionerRole having duplicate code values is not a big concern (and is used for discovery where required). e.g. These references are all very context specific: Patient.GeneralPractitioner, CarePlan.reported, CarePlan.contributor, Appointment.participant (through the participant.role), Immunization.informationSource, Immunization.performer (through the performer.function property) For use cases where an organization has activities where a practitioner is not defined/pre-allocated for a specific role (e.g. an un-named surgeon at XYZ Hospital), a PractitionerRole resource can be used with an empty Practitioner property, and the other relevant role properties populated - i.e. code, organization. Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles.

The Organization resource is used for collections of people that have come together to achieve an objective. The Group resource is used to identify a collection of people (or animals, devices, etc.) that are gathered for the purpose of analysis or acting upon, but are not expected to act themselves.

{"resource": "Observation", "description": "The FHIR Observation resource is a cornerstone in the healthcare data model, designed to document a vast array of clinical information essential for patient care. This resource plays a pivotal role in capturing observations that support clinical diagnoses, monitor patient progress, establish baseline health metrics, and identify patterns over time. It also encompasses the recording of demographic characteristics and results of tests performed on products and substances, providing a comprehensive view of patient health and healthcare interventions. Observations recorded in this resource often appear as simple name/value pair assertions, such as a blood pressure reading or body temperature measurement, accompanied by relevant metadata. However, the Observation resource is not limited to simple data points. It also supports more complex entries that logically group multiple observations together or contain several components. This flexibility allows healthcare providers to document a broad spectrum of clinical data with precision and detail. The types of data captured by the Observation resource are extensive and varied. Vital signs, such as body weight, blood pressure, and temperature, are routinely recorded, providing critical information for ongoing patient monitoring. Laboratory data, including blood glucose levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other biochemical markers, are documented to inform diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Imaging results, such as bone density measurements or fetal ultrasound findings, are also captured within this resource, offering valuable insights into patient conditions that require visual assessment. Clinical findings, another category of data within the Observation resource, include detailed observations like abdominal tenderness or the presence of a rash. These findings are crucial for forming diagnostic impressions and planning treatment strategies. Additionally, the resource records device measurements, such as electrocardiogram (EKG) data or pulse oximetry readings, which are essential for monitoring the functioning of the heart and oxygenation status of the patient. Device settings, including parameters for mechanical ventilators, are documented to ensure proper configuration and management of medical devices used in patient care. Clinical assessment tools, such as the APGAR score for newborns or the Glasgow Coma Scale for assessing consciousness in trauma patients, are recorded within the Observation resource, providing standardized measures of patient status. Personal characteristics, such as eye color, and social history elements, like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status, are included to give a holistic view of the patient's background and lifestyle factors that may influence health outcomes. Core characteristics, including pregnancy status or assertions of death, are also documented, ensuring that critical information about the patient's current condition is readily available. The Observation resource is designed to express a wide range of data through either simple name-value pairs or structured collections of name-value pairs. This design allows it to capture measurements and subjective point-in-time assessments accurately.

{"resource": "DocumentReference", "description": "A DocumentReference resource is used to index a document, clinical note, and other binary objects such as a photo, video, or audio recording, including those resulting from diagnostic or care provision procedures, to make them available to a healthcare system. A document is some sequence of bytes that is identifiable, establishes its own context (e.g., what subject, author, etc. can be presented to the user), and has defined update management. The DocumentReference resource can be used with any document format that has a recognized mime type and that conforms to this definition.\n\nTypically, DocumentReference resources are used in document indexing systems, such as IHE XDS icon and as profiled in IHE Mobile Access to Health Documents icon.\n\nDocumentReference contains metadata, inline content or direct references to documents such as:\n\nCDA icon documents in FHIR systems\nFHIR documents stored elsewhere (i.e. registry/repository following the XDS model)\nPDF documents icon, Scanned Paper, and digital records of faxes\nClinical Notes in various forms\nImage files (e.g., JPEG, GIF, TIFF)\nVideo files (e.g., MP4, WMV)\nAudio files (e.g., WAV, MP3)\nNon-Standard formats (e.g., CSV, RTF, WORD)\nOther kinds of documents, such as records of prescriptions or immunizations. This resource captures data that might not be in FHIR format. The document can be any object (e.g. file), and is not limited to the formal HL7 definitions of Document. This resource may be a report with unstructured text or a report that is not expressed in a DiagnosticReport. The DiagnosticReport is appropriate to reflect a set of discrete results (Observations) and associated contextual details for a specific report, and within those results any further structure within the Observation instances. The DocumentReference resource may be an Observation whose value is audio, video or image data. This resource is the preferred representation of such forms of information as it exposes the metadata relevant for interpreting the information. There is some overlap potential such as a scan of a CBC report that can either be referenced by way of a DocumentReference, or included in a DiagnosticReport as a presentedForm together with the structured, discrete data. Specific implementation guides would further clarify when one approach is more appropriate than another.\n\nThis resource is able to contain medical images in a DICOM format. These images may also be made accessible through an ImagingStudy resource, which provides a direct reference to the image to a WADO-RS server. For such images, the WADO-RS framework is a preferred method for representing the images - the WADO-RS service may include rendering the image with annotations and display parameters from an associated DICOM presentation state, for instance. On the other hand, the DocumentReference resource allows for a robust transfer of an image across boundaries where the WADO-RS service is not available. For this reason, medical images can also be represented in a DocumentReference resource, but the DocumentReference.content.attachment.url should provide a reference to a source WADO-RS service for the image.\n\nFHIR defines both a document format and this document reference. FHIR documents are for documents that are authored and assembled in FHIR. DocumentReference is intended for general references to any type of media file including assembled documents.\n\nThe document that is a target of the reference can be a reference to a FHIR document served by another server, or the target can be stored in the special FHIR Binary Resource, or the target can be stored on some other server system. The document reference is also able to address documents that are retrieved by a service call such as an XDS.b RetrieveDocumentSet, or a DICOM exchange, or an HL7 V2 icon message query - though the way each of these service calls works must be specified in some external standard or other documentation.\n\nA DocumentReference describes some other document. This means that there are two sets of provenance information relevant here: the provenance of the document, and the provenance of the document reference. Sometimes, the provenance information is closely related, as when the document producer also produces the document reference, but in other workflows, the document reference is generated later by other actors. In the DocumentReference resource, the meta content refers to the provenance of the reference itself, while the content described below concerns the document it references. Like all resources, there is overlap between the information in the resource directly, and in the general Provenance resource.

{"resource": "DiagnosticReport", "description": "The DiagnosticReport resource in FHIR serves as a comprehensive framework for documenting the outcomes of diagnostic services once investigations are complete. It encompasses a variety of data types including atomic results, textual summaries, images, and coded interpretations, depending on the nature of the diagnostic procedure and the specific outcomes observed. This resource is structured to facilitate the representation of clinical context alongside detailed findings, making it suitable for various diagnostic scenarios such as laboratory tests (Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Microbiology), pathology and histopathology examinations, imaging investigations (x-ray, CT, MRI), and other specialized diagnostics like cardiology and gastroenterology. Each DiagnosticReport entry contains essential metadata about the report itself, the subject (patient), and often details about the specimen if applicable, linking back to the request for the diagnostic investigation. Reports may include conclusions presented as simple text summaries, structured coded data, or fully formatted reports such as PDFs, ensuring flexibility in how results are conveyed. It is important to note that the DiagnosticReport resource does not aim to support cumulative result presentations or detailed structured reports of sequencing in its current version, though plans for future updates may include these capabilities. The resource distinguishes itself from the Observation resource by its ability to provide richer clinical context and aggregated findings, which may include nested structures of Observations (traditionally known as panels or batteries in laboratory settings) to depict relationships between individual data items. For complex imaging studies or genomic data, the DiagnosticReport references related studies through the study element, linking to ImagingStudy resources for DICOM imaging or GenomicStudy resources for genomic analyses. Images and media associated with the report can be referenced directly through the media element, enriching the comprehensive data representation within the resource. In contrast to DocumentReference, which typically points to non-FHIR objects like scanned documents or narrative notes, DiagnosticReport focuses on discrete results and associated contextual details within a FHIR-compliant framework.

{"resource": "QuestionnaireResponse","description":"QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. The questions may be included directly or by reference to a Questionnaire resource that defines the questions as well as the constraints on the allowed answers. In some cases, both formal rules for editing the questionnaire (via link to Questionnaire) as well as sufficient local information to allow rendering of the questionnaire may be provided. Each time a questionnaire is completed for a different subject or at a different time, a distinct QuestionnaireResponse is generated, though it may be possible for a previously entered set of answers to be edited or updated. Questionnaire responses cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaire responses record specifics about data capture - exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what answers were given, etc. Each of these questions is part of the Questionnaire, and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not.\n\nExamples of Questionnaires include:\n- Past medical history (PMH)\n- Family diseases\n- Social history\n- Research questionnaires and Case report forms (CRFs)\n- Quality and evaluation forms\n- Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)\n- Insurance claim form\n\nQuestionnaireResponse resources can be validated against their corresponding Questionnaire to verify that required groups and questions are answered and that answers fit constraints in terms of cardinality, data type, etc. The QuestionnaireResponse resource captures the responses to a questionnaire, while Questionnaire represents the definition of the questionnaire form, including what questions are asked, how they're organized and the constraints on the allowed answers. While Observation, with its nested component structure, can create complex hierarchies of questions and answers, the focus is different. First, Observation is used primarily for capturing data elements that are 'true' observations - lab measurements, vital signs, social assessments, etc., while QuestionnaireResponse can be used to capture any types of data, including data that would typically map to other resources (Procedure, Patient, MedicationStatement, etc.). Second, the focus of QuestionnaireResponse includes the specific phrasing and organization of the questions. All data must be explicitly captured as a question.

{"resource": "AllergyIntolerance","description": "A record of a clinical assessment of an allergy or intolerance; a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have an adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.\n\nWhere a propensity is identified, to record information or evidence about a reaction event that is characterized by any harmful or undesirable physiological response that is specific to the individual and triggered by exposure of an individual to the identified substance or class of substance.\n\nSubstances include, but are not limited to: a therapeutic substance administered correctly at an appropriate dosage for the individual; food; material derived from plants or animals; or venom from insect stings. This resource is used to provide a single place within the health record to document a range of clinical statements about adverse reactions to substances/products, including:\n\nrecord a clinical assessment of the individual's propensity to a potential future reaction upon re-exposure\nrecord cumulative information about the reaction to each exposure, including 'no reaction' if appropriate\nUse to record information about the positive presence of the risk of an adverse reaction:\n\n  - to support direct clinical care of an individual\n  - as part of a managed adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list\n  - to support exchange of information about the propensity and events related to adverse reactions\n  - to inform adverse reaction reporting\n  - to assist computerized knowledge-based activities such as clinical decision support and alerts\n\nUse to record information about adverse reactions to a broad range of substances, including: biological & blood products; incipients and excipients in medicinal preparations; foods; metal salts; and organic chemical compounds.\n\nAdverse reactions may be:\n\n  - an allergy (typically type I hypersensitivity, plus other 'allergy-like' reactions, including pseudoallergy)\n  - an intolerance (typically non-immune adverse reactions that are not determined or perceived to be allergic or 'allergy-like', and are to some degree idiosyncratic and/or individually specific [i.e. are not a reaction that is expected to occur with most or all patients given similar circumstances])\n\nIn clinical practice distinguishing between allergy and intolerance is difficult and might not be practical. Often the term 'allergy' is used rather generically and may overlap with 'intolerance', and the boundaries between these concepts might not be well-defined or understood. As noted above, the term 'intolerance' should generally be applied to a propensity for adverse reactions which is either determined (to the extent that is possible) or perceived to not be allergic or 'allergy-like'. If it is not possible to determine whether a particular propensity condition is an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource. Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient, which is better expressed in the documentation of the clinical manifestation and the assessment of criticality.\n\nThe sensitivity in the case of either an allergy or intolerance is unique to the individual, and is distinguished from those reactions that are a property of the circumstance, such as toxicity of a food or drug, overdose, drug-drug, drug-food, or drug-disease interaction (which are reactions that would be expected to occur for any individual given the same circumstances).\n\nThe risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation should not be recorded without identifying a proposed causative substance (including pharmaceutical products) or class of substance. If there is uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, this uncertainty can be recorded using the 'verificationStatus' data element. If there are multiple possible substances that may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this resource with the 'verificationStatus' set to an initial state of 'unconfirmed' so that adverse reaction checking can be supported in clinical systems. If a substance, agent or class is later proven not to be the cause for a given reaction then the 'verificationStatus' can be modified to 'refuted'.\n\nThis resource has been designed to allow recording of information about a specific substance (e.g., amoxicillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or pharmaceutical product or, alternatively, a class of substance (e.g., penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded, then identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per exposure basis.\n\nThe scope of this FHIR resource has deliberately focused on identifying a pragmatic data set that is used in most clinical systems or will be suitable for most common clinical scenarios; extensions can be used to add additional detail if required. Examples of clinical situations where the extension may be required include: a detailed allergist/immunologist assessment, for reporting to regulatory bodies or use in a clinical trial.\n\nThe act of recording any adverse reaction in a health record involves the clinical assessment that a potential hazard exists for an individual if they are exposed to the same substance/product/class in the future - that is, a relative contraindication - and, in the absence of additional information indicating a higher level of potential risk, the default 'criticality' value should be set to 'Low Risk'. If a clinician considers that it is not safe for the individual to be deliberately re-exposed to the substance/product again, for example, following a manifestation of a life-threatening anaphylaxis, then the 'criticality' data element should be amended to 'High Risk'.\n\nA formal adverse event report to regulatory bodies is a document that will contain a broad range of information in addition to the specific details about the adverse reaction. The report could utilize parts of this resource plus include additional data as required per jurisdiction.\n\nAn adverse reaction or allergy/intolerance list is a record of all identified propensities for an adverse reaction for the individual upon future exposure to the substance/product or class, plus provides potential access to the evidence provided by details about each reaction event, such as manifestation.\n\nValuable first-level information that could be presented to the clinician when they need to assess propensity for future reactions are:\n\n  - statements about previous clinical manifestations following exposure\n  - source of the information/reporter\n  - the 'criticality' flag\n\nSecond-level information can be drawn from each exposure event and links to additional detailed information such as history, examination and diagnoses stored elsewhere in the record, if it is available.\n\nAllergyIntolerance and RiskAssessment\n\nAllergyIntolerance describes a specific type of risk - propensity to reaction to a substance/product while RiskAssessment describes general risks to a subject, not generally based on a reaction.\n\nAllergyIntolerance and Immunization.reaction\n\nImmunization.reaction may be an indication of an allergy or intolerance. If this is deemed to be the case, a separate AllergyIntolerance record should be created to indicate it, as most systems will not query against past immunization.reactions.\n\nMisuse\n\nThe allergy/intolerance list exists as a patient safety tool to inform decision support around ordering of medications and nutrition and to guide clinical treatment.

{"resource": "ClinicalImpression","description": "Performing a clinical assessment is a fundamental part of a clinician's workflow, performed repeatedly throughout the day. In spite of this - or perhaps, because of it - there is wide variance in how clinical impressions are recorded. Some clinical assessments simply result in an impression recorded as a single text note in the patient 'record' (e.g. 'Progress satisfactory, continue with treatment'), while others are associated with careful, detailed record keeping of the evidence gathered and the reasoning leading to a differential diagnosis, and there is a continuum between these. This resource is intended to be used to cover all these use cases.\n\nThe assessment is intimately linked to the process of care. It may occur in the context of a care plan, and it very often results in a new (or revised) care plan. Normally, clinical assessments are part of an ongoing process of care, and the patient will be re-assessed repeatedly. For this reason, the clinical impression can explicitly reference both care plans (preceding and resulting) and reference a previous impression that this impression follows.\n\nAn impression is a clinical summation of information and/or an opinion formed, which is the outcome of the clinical assessment process. The ClinicalImpression may lead to a statement of a Condition about a patient.\n\nIn FHIR, an assessment is typically an instrument or tool used to collect information about a patient. ClinicalImpression is the equivalent of the 'A' (assessment) in the SOAP note format originally described by Lawrence Weed, MD. It is the outcome of the clinical assessment process. The ClinicalImpression may lead to a statement of a Condition about a patient. There is another related clinical concept often called an 'assessment': assessment Tools such as Apgar (also known as 'Assessment Scales'). This is not what the ClinicalImpression resource is about; assessment tools such as Apgar are represented as Observations, and Questionnaires may be used to help generate these. Clinical Impressions may refer to these assessment tools as one of the investigations that was performed during the assessment process.","structure": {"resourceType": "ClinicalImpression","identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"status": "<code>","statusReason": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"description": "<string>","subject": {"Reference": "Group|Patient"},"encounter": {"Reference": "Encounter"},"effective[x]": {"effectiveDateTime": "<dateTime>","effectivePeriod": {"Period": {}}},"date": "<dateTime>","performer": {"Reference": "Practitioner|PractitionerRole"},"previous": {"Reference": "ClinicalImpression"},"problem": [{"Reference": "AllergyIntolerance|Condition"}],"changePattern": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"protocol": ["<uri>"],"summary": "<string>","finding": [{"item": {"CodeableReference": "Condition|DocumentReference|Observation"},"basis": "<string>"}],"prognosisCodeableConcept": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"prognosisReference": [{"Reference": "RiskAssessment"}],"supportingInfo": [{"Reference": "Any"}],"note": [{"Annotation": {}}]}}
{"resource": "DetectedIssue","description": "This resource applies to various circumstances where there is a concern about an existing or proposed set of clinical activity. The issue could relate to single, proposed, or multiple actions. It does not apply to technical issues (e.g. lack of user permissions) but could relate to violation of patient consent limitations. Examples include: Drug-drug interactionsInappropriate therapy (wrong dose, frequency, body site)Duplicate therapyGaps in careThis resource represents a specific instance of a potential issue for a particular patient. It is not intended to represent general patient-independent knowledge, the ClinicalUseDefinition resource is defined for that purpose. This resource is also not intended to be used in defining general prohibitions on actions such as 'No NSAIDs', 'No solid oral dose forms' or 'No MRIs - metallic tattoos'. These guidelines can be captured using the AllergyIntolerance, AdverseEvent and/or Flag resources. Similarly, this resource is not to be used to capture clinical facts that may imply contraindications such as pregnancy, breast feeding, patient preferences, past procedures, etc. These would be represented using Condition, Procedure or other resources. This resource only applies to documenting a risk associated with a specific planned or ongoing action, or the lack of an action which should be planned - not a general propensity to risk. The latter would be handled using AllergyIntolerance for substance-specific issues or Flag for other types of issues. In addition, the resource represents patient-specific and time-bound risk manifestations, not generic knowledge statements about risks that can exist. This resource is limited to clinical issues associated with a proposed or ongoing action. It does not cover technical issues such as lack of permission, duplicate identifiers, insufficient data, and other business rule violations. Technical issues are conveyed using the OperationOutcome resource. It is possible to have both OperationOutcome and DetectedIssue together, where the OperationOutcome might indicate that a requested action was rejected due to a clinical issue and the DetectedIssue provides the details of the issue. Detected issues are typically identified by decision support systems. However, they may also be captured directly by clinicians. The latter typically happens for one of two reasons:A clinician wishes to communicate an issue to another clinician whose responsibility would be to resolve it (e.g. a pharmacist identifying an issue with a prescription prior to putting it on hold)A clinician wishes to pre-emptively identify that an issue is known and is being managed (to avoid red flags being raised as part of downstream workflow); e.g. Submitting a new order and including a link to a 'duplicate therapy' issue with mitigation indicating that the therapy is not considered to be duplicate.Decision-support generated issues can result from calling a decision-support engine directly (e.g. via a custom OperationDefinition) or as part of an attempt to perform some other function (creating an order, submitting an insurance claim, capturing a medication list). When the issues are generated as a by-product of performing some other sort of action, they may be included in the 'response' to the requested action in the same manner as an OperationOutcome. In fact, both may be present - the OperationOutcome indicating that there was a warning or error associated with the request and a DetectedIssue providing the clinical details. (The OperationOutcome could point to the DetectedIssue via an extension.) In those circumstances where requested operations are rejected as a result of a detected issue, the workflow may support allowing the operation to be re-tried, provided that the identified issue is included as part of the submission (possibly also including a mitigation). In doing so, the sender acknowledges the issue and takes responsibility for it, thus allowing the requested operation to proceed. See Linking to Detected Issues for guidance on how a DetectedIssue instance might be included as part of another operation.Systems that require such workflows should document expected behavior as part of their CapabilityStatement declarations.","structure": {"resourceType": "DetectedIssue","identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"status": "<code>","category": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"code": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"severity": "<code>","subject": {"Reference": "BiologicallyDerivedProduct|Device|Group|Location|Medication|NutritionProduct|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|Procedure|Substance"},"encounter": {"Reference": "Encounter"},"identified[x]": {"identifiedDateTime": "<dateTime>","identifiedPeriod": {"Period": {}}},"author": {"Reference": "Device|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson"},"implicated": [{"Reference": "Any"}],"evidence": [{"code": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"detail": [{"Reference": "Any"}]}],"detail": "<markdown>","reference": "<uri>","mitigation": [{"action": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"date": "<dateTime>","author": {"Reference": "Practitioner|PractitionerRole"},"note": [{"Annotation": {}}]}]}}

This includes immunization of both humans and animals but does not include the administration of non-vaccine agents, even those that may have or claim to have immunological effects. While the terms 'immunization' and 'vaccination' are not clinically identical, for the purposes of the FHIR resources, the terms are used synonymously.\n\nAdditionally, the Immunization resource is expected to cover key concepts related to the creation, revision and querying of a patient's immunization history. This resource - through consultation with the Public Health work group - is believed to meet key use cases and information requirements as defined in the existing HL7 V2 icon immunization implementation guide, HL7 v3 icon POIZ domain and Immunization Domain Analysis Model. Administration of vaccines is intended to be handled using the Immunization resource. MedicationAdministration is intended for tracking the administration of non-vaccine medications. Some systems treat immunizations in the same way as any other medication administration. Such systems SHOULD use an immunization resource to represent these. If systems need to use a MedicationAdministration resource to capture vaccinations for workflow or other reasons, they SHOULD also expose an equivalent Immunization instance.\n\nWhile the Immunization and MedicationAdministration resources are distinct, they are both able to capture specific details of the administered product. The Immunization resource uses Immunization.vaccineCode to indicate the nature of the vaccine administered to the patient. The Immunization.administeredProduct may additionally be used to identify the specific product used (either as a coded value or as a reference to a Medication resource). The Immunization resource also contains data about the administered vaccine including the manufacturer, lot number and expiration date. However, the data elements contained within Immunization are expected to only be used when Immunization.administeredProduct does not reference a Medication resource which contains the same information about the product.\n\nSimilarly, MedicationAdministrative.medication references a Medication resource which is used to identify the administered product. Medication.marketingAuthorizationHolder, Medication.batch.lotNumber and Medication.batch.expirationDate are all analogous to the Immunization resource elements and are similarly used to capture details of the administered product.\n\nImmunization.reaction may be an indication of an allergy or intolerance.

{"resource": "ImmunizationEvaluation","description": " The ImmunizationEvaluation resource is intended to cover communicating the results of an evaluation of a vaccine administration event (documented using the Immunization resource) against a set of published recommendations (protocols). Evaluating administered doses in a patient's immunization history is central to ensuring that the patient is fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. It is also a necessary prerequisite to generating a customized set of immunization recommendations for the patient. The ImmunizationEvaluation resource communicates the results of an evaluation of an instance of the Immunization resource relative to a set of published recommendations. It is intended to communicate if the vaccine administration event was 'valid' or 'not valid' relative to the recommendations. Once all vaccine administration events in a patient's record have been evaluated, it is then possible to generate a set of vaccination related recommendations, unique for the patient. These recommendations are communicated using the ImmunizationRecommendation resource.\n\nAs the ImmunizationEvaluation resource is focused on the evaluation of a single vaccine administration event, it does not include data regarding the overall patient status relative to the recommendations used in the evaluation.

{"resource": "CarePlan", "description": "CarePlan is one of the request resources in the FHIR workflow specification.\n\nCare Plans are used in many areas of healthcare with a variety of scopes. They can be as simple as a general practitioner keeping track of when their patient is next due for a tetanus immunization through to a detailed plan for an oncology patient covering diet, chemotherapy, radiation, lab work and counseling with detailed timing relationships, pre-conditions and goals. They may be used in veterinary care or clinical research to describe the care of a herd or other collection of animals. In public health, they may describe education or immunization campaigns.\n\nThis resource takes an intermediate approach to complexity. It captures basic details about who is involved and what actions are intended without dealing in discrete data about dependencies and timing relationships. These can be supported where necessary using the extension mechanism.\n\nThe scope of care plans may vary widely. Examples include:\n\n- Multi-disciplinary cross-organizational care plans; e.g. An oncology plan including the oncologist, home nursing staff, pharmacy and others\n- Plans to manage specific disease/condition(s) (e.g. nutritional plan for a patient post bowel resection, neurological plan post head injury, prenatal plan, postpartum plan, grief management plan, etc.)\n- Decision support generated plans following specific practice guidelines (e.g. stroke care plan, diabetes plan, falls prevention, etc.)\n- Self-maintained patient or care-giver authored plans identifying their goals and an integrated understanding of actions to be taken. This does not include the legal Advance Directives, which should be represented with either the Consent resource with Consent.category = Advance Directive or with a specific request resource with intent = directive. Informal advance directives could be represented as a Goal, such as \"I want to die at home.\"\n\nThis resource can be used to represent both proposed plans (for example, recommendations from a decision support engine or returned as part of a consult report) as well as active plans. The nature of the plan is communicated by the status. Some systems may need to filter CarePlans to ensure that only appropriate plans are exposed via a given user interface. CarePlan activities can be defined using references to the various \"request\" resources. These references could be to resources with a status of \"planned\" or to an active order. It is possible for planned activities to exist (e.g. appointments) without needing a CarePlan at all. CarePlans are used when there's a need to group activities, goals and/or participants together to provide some degree of context.\n\nCarePlans can be tied to specific Conditions, however they can also be condition-independent and instead focused on a particular type of care (e.g. psychological, nutritional) or the care delivered by a particular practitioner or group of practitioners.\n\nAn ImmunizationRecommendation can be interpreted as a narrow type of CarePlan dealing only with immunization events. Where such information could appear in either resource, the immunization-specific resource is preferred.\n\nCarePlans represent a specific plan instance for a particular patient or group. It is not intended to be used to define generic plans or protocols that are independent of a specific individual or group. CarePlan represents a specific intent, not a general definition.

{"resource": "Goal", "description": "A Goal in health care services delivery is generally an expressed desired health state to be achieved by a subject of care (or family/group) over a period or at a specific point of time. This desired target health state may be achieved as a result of health care intervention(s) or resulting from natural recovery over time. For example: A goal of a plan for a condition such as a diabetes might specify desired outcome(s) (e.g. HgbA1c level =<5.6% in 3 months) as a result of interventions such as medication therapy, nutritional management and/or increased physical activity. A goal of a procedure might be to meet the intended objective of the procedure (e.g. wet-dry-dressing changes twice a day; goal: wound healed completely in 2 weeks) or to prevent an unintended complication (e.g. repositioning a patient every two hours: goal to maintain skin integrity) Goals may address the prevention of illness, cure or mitigation of a condition, prolongation of life, or mitigation of pain and discomfort. When dealing with groups, goals may also reflect health state, such as a reduction of addiction behaviors. However, they may also reflect population health objectives such as education, screening, etc. Organizational goals are typically not health state specific but may instead identify measurement targets such as infection control, cost management, patient satisfaction, etc. Goals are typically established in the context of a CarePlan. However, goals may also be directly referenced by request-type resources (e.g. MedicationRequest or ServiceRequest) by using an extension. A goal represents a specific goal instance for a particular patient, group, etc. It is not intended to be used to define types of potential goals as part of an order set or protocol definition. Protocol definitions and order sets are supported through PlanDefinition. The Goal resource is intended to be used once an order set is instantiated or assigned to a patient, which is when the potential goals become the actual goals, if not changed or deleted. Goals are often evaluated using Observations. Goal does not include the legal Advance Directives, which should be represented with the Consent resource with Consent.category = Advance Directive or a request resource with the intent = directive.

{"resource": "ServiceRequest", "description": "ServiceRequest represents an order or proposal or plan, as distinguished by ServiceRequest.intent to perform a diagnostic or other service on or for a patient. ServiceRequest represents a proposal or plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure or DiagnosticReport, which in turn may reference one or more Observations, which summarize the performance of the procedures and associated documentation such as observations, images, findings that are relevant to the treatment/management of the subject. This resource may be used to share relevant information required to support a referral or a transfer of care request from one practitioner or organization to another when a patient is required to be referred to another provider for a consultation/second opinion and/or for short term or longer term management of one or more health issues or problems. Examples include: diagnostic tests/studies, endoscopic procedures, counseling, biopsies, therapies (e.g., physio-, social-, psychological-), (exploratory) surgeries or procedures, exercises, specialist consultation and assessments, community services, nursing services, pharmacist medication review, and other clinical interventions. Procedures may be performed by a healthcare professional, a friend or relative or in some cases by the patient themselves. The principal intention of ServiceRequest is to support ordering procedures for one patient (which includes non-human patients in veterinary medicine). However, in many contexts, healthcare related processes include performing diagnostic investigations on groups of subjects, devices involved in the provision of healthcare, and even environmental locations such as ducts, bodies of water, etc. ServiceRequest supports all these usages. The service request may represent an order that is entered by a practitioner in a CPOE system as well as a proposal made by a clinical decision support (CDS) system based on a patient's clinical record and context of care. Planned procedures referenced by a CarePlan may also be represented by this resource. The general work flow that this resource facilitates is that a clinical system creates a service request. The service request is then accessed by or exchanged with a system, perhaps via intermediaries, that represents an organization (e.g., diagnostic or imaging service, surgical team, physical therapy department) that can perform the procedure. The organization receiving the service request will, after it accepts the request, update the request as the work is performed, and then finally issue a report that references the requests that it fulfilled. The ServiceRequest resource allows requesting only a single procedure. If a workflow requires requesting multiple procedures simultaneously, this is done using multiple instances of this resource. These instances can be linked in different ways, depending on the needs of the workflow. For guidance, refer to the Request pattern. ServiceRequest is a record of a proposal/plan or order for a service to be performed that would result in a Procedure, Observation, DiagnosticReport, ImagingStudy or similar resource. In contrast to ServiceRequest, Task which spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to completion and is intended for 'administrative' actions like requesting and tracking things to be done to a record, or keeping track of a checklist of steps such to be performed as part of a fulfilment process. A ServiceRequest can be higher-level authorization that triggered the creation of Task, or it can be the 'request' resource Task is seeking to fulfill. ServiceRequest and CommunicationRequest are related. A CommunicationRequest is a request to merely disclose information. Whereas a ServiceRequest would be used to request information as part of training or counseling - i.e. when the process will involve verification of the patient's comprehension or an attempt to change the patient's mental state. In some workflows both may exist. For example, upon receiving a CommunicationRequest a practitioner might initiate a ServiceRequest.", "structure": { "resourceType": "ServiceRequest", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "instantiatesCanonical": [ "<canonical(ActivityDefinition|PlanDefinition)>" ], "instantiatesUri": [ "<uri>" ], "basedOn": [ { "Reference(CarePlan|MedicationRequest|ServiceRequest)": {} } ], "replaces": [ { "Reference(ServiceRequest)": {} } ], "requisition": { "Identifier": {} }, "status": "<code>", "intent": "<code>", "category": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "priority": "<code>", "doNotPerform": "<boolean>", "code": { "CodeableReference(ActivityDefinition|PlanDefinition)": {} }, "orderDetail": [ { "parameterFocus": { "CodeableReference(BiologicallyDerivedProduct|Device|DeviceDefinition|DeviceRequest|Medication|MedicationRequest|Substance|SupplyRequest)": {} }, "parameter": [ { "code": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "valueQuantity": { "Quantity": {} }, "valueRatio": { "Ratio": {} }, "valueRange": { "Range": {} }, "valueBoolean": "<boolean>", "valueCodeableConcept": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "valueString": "<string>", "valuePeriod": { "Period": {} } } ] } ], "quantityQuantity": { "Quantity": {} }, "quantityRatio": { "Ratio": {} }, "quantityRange": { "Range": {} }, "subject": { "Reference(Device|Group|Location|Patient)": {} }, "focus": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "occurrenceDateTime": "<dateTime>", "occurrencePeriod": { "Period": {} }, "occurrenceTiming": { "Timing": {} }, "asNeededBoolean": "<boolean>", "asNeededCodeableConcept": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "authoredOn": "<dateTime>", "requester": { "Reference(Device|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "performerType": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "performer": [ { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|HealthcareService|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} } ], "location": [ { "CodeableReference(Location)": {} } ], "reason": [ { "CodeableReference(Condition|DetectedIssue|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Observation)": {} } ], "insurance": [ { "Reference(ClaimResponse|Coverage)": {} } ], "supportingInfo": [ { "CodeableReference(Any)": {} } ], "specimen": [ { "Reference(Specimen)": {} } ], "bodySite": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "bodyStructure": { "Reference(BodyStructure)": {} }, "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ], "patientInstruction": [ { "instructionMarkdown": "<markdown>", "instructionReference": { "Reference(DocumentReference)": {} } } ], "relevantHistory": [ { "Reference(Provenance)": {} } ] } } 
{"resource": "NutritionOrder", "description": "The NutritionOrder resource describes a request for oral diets (including general diets such as General Healthy diet, or therapeutic diets such as Consistent Carbohydrate, 2 gram Sodium, or Fluid Restricted), oral nutrition supplements (such as nutritionally complete pre-packed drinks), enteral nutrition (tube feedings) and infant formula which govern the distribution of food and nutritional products used to feed patients within an in-patient setting. It does not cover orders for parenteral (IV) nutrition which are typically filled by pharmacy. These nutrition orders are combined with information on a patient's food allergies and intolerances, and ethnic or cultural food preferences (e.g. Kosher or Vegetarian) to inform healthcare personnel about the type, texture, and/or quantity of foods that the patient should receive or consume. Enteral orders are distinguished from supplements because they have some unique attributes and typically include administration information whereas oral nutritional supplements may simply be supplied (e.g. home health or outpatient settings). In a simple case, the requestor may designate type of product, product name and the route of administration along with free text instructions without a having to complete the additional structured details. This resource is intended to be used by providers from a variety of specialties such as physicians, dietitian/nutritionists, or speech therapists. One provider may simply order a base element oral diet such as General Healthful diet. Another provider, based on scope of practice, may use other elements to communicate additional therapeutic needs or patient preferences. The optionality included gives an ordering provider the capability to write a simple order for an oral diet, nutritional supplement or formula with minimal requirements beyond that of specifying the diet, supplement or formula product, but also supports the ability to provide more detailed information that may be further augmented by a dietitian or nutrition specialist. For example, a physician may order a 2 g sodium diet. A speech therapist, based on the results of a swallowing evaluation, then orders a mechanically altered texture with nectar thick liquids. The NutritionOrder resource is used for requesting oral diets, oral nutrition supplements and enteral feedings in an in-patient setting. The MedicationRequest resource should be used for requesting parenteral (IV) nutrition and prescribing dietary supplements such as vitamin or mineral supplements. The Nutrition Order is a record of the request for the supply of a diet, oral supplement or enteral formulas for a patient. However, to initiate the request requires the use of the Task resource and its associated workflow with the Nutrition Order referenced from Task.basedOn, or by using the Nutrition Task resource in the context of a messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.", "structure": { "resourceType": "NutritionOrder", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "instantiatesCanonical": [ "<canonical(ActivityDefinition|PlanDefinition)>" ], "instantiatesUri": [ "<uri>" ], "instantiates": [ "<uri>" ], "basedOn": [ { "Reference(CarePlan|NutritionOrder|ServiceRequest)": {} } ], "groupIdentifier": { "Identifier": {} }, "status": "<code>", "intent": "<code>", "priority": "<code>", "subject": { "Reference(Group|Patient)": {} }, "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "supportingInformation": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "dateTime": "<dateTime>", "orderer": { "Reference(Practitioner|PractitionerRole)": {} }, "performer": [ { "CodeableReference(CareTeam|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} } ], "allergyIntolerance": [ { "Reference(AllergyIntolerance)": {} } ], "foodPreferenceModifier": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "excludeFoodModifier": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "outsideFoodAllowed": "<boolean>", "oralDiet": { "type": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "schedule": { "timing": [ { "Timing": {} } ], "asNeeded": "<boolean>", "asNeededFor": { "CodeableConcept": {} } }, "nutrient": [ { "modifier": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "amount": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} } } ], "texture": [ { "modifier": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "foodType": { "CodeableConcept": {} } } ], "fluidConsistencyType": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "instruction": "<string>" }, "supplement": [ { "type": { "CodeableReference(NutritionProduct)": {} }, "productName": "<string>", "schedule": { "timing": [ { "Timing": {} } ], "asNeeded": "<boolean>", "asNeededFor": { "CodeableConcept": {} } }, "quantity": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} }, "instruction": "<string>" } ], "enteralFormula": { "baseFormulaType": { "CodeableReference(NutritionProduct)": {} }, "baseFormulaProductName": "<string>", "deliveryDevice": [ { "CodeableReference(DeviceDefinition)": {} } ], "additive": [ { "type": { "CodeableReference(NutritionProduct)": {} }, "productName": "<string>", "quantity": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} } } ], "caloricDensity": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} }, "routeOfAdministration": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "administration": [ { "schedule": { "timing": [ { "Timing": {} } ], "asNeeded": "<boolean>", "asNeededFor": { "CodeableConcept": {} } }, "quantity": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} }, "rateQuantity": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} }, "rateRatio": { "Ratio": {} } } ], "maxVolumeToDeliver": { "Quantity(SimpleQuantity)": {} }, "administrationInstruction": "<markdown>" }, "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ] } } 
{"resource": "NutritionIntake", "description": "The NutritionIntake resource, in conjunction with the NutritionProduct resource, is utilized to capture details about the consumption of foods, fluids, and enteral nutrition. Dietitians and other clinicians use the data to calculate how much nutrition a patient has taken in. NutritionIntake represents the event of consuming food, fluid, etc. and NutritionProduct represents the actual food items. NutritionIntake can also be used to record a personâ€™s intake through uses of food tracking apps (e.g.MyFitnessPal), any grocery store purchases, or a studentâ€™s meal consumption in a school district. NutritionIntake can be utilized in many environments where food is served, consumed or purchased: hospitals/acute care, meal tracking systems, school districts, grocery stores, outpatient settings, LTC, etc. NutritionIntake should be general enough to capture intake regardless of country or region. Parenteral nutrition is out of scope as this ordering is handled through MedicationRequest, thus administration of parenteral nutrition should also be captured through Oral intake of food, fluids, oral nutritional supplements (i.e. Ensure), or enteral nutrition should be recorded using the NutritionIntake resource. Supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, herbals, should be recorded using the medication resources Parenteral nutrition should be recorded using the medication resources As a dietitian, it is important to be able to know what a person is consuming and assess the adequacy of the patientâ€™s diet. Capturing a patientâ€™s intake is important to establish a baseline, determine care, track trends, and see improvement of that patient. Dietitians might use intake data to see patterns, such as when a diabetic patientâ€™s blood glucose is consistently high due to over consumption of carbohydrates. Other clinicians have the need to monitor intake as well; for example, a nurse might need to know intake for administering insulin prior to meals or a physician may need to ensure a patient on a fluid restriction is following orders. Having intake documented within its own resource allows for consistency in documentation acrossmultiple disciplines and settings. In some instances, the Observation resource has been extended to capture intake; while this allows for a quick way to document intake, the Observation resource does not provide all the detail necessary, such as capturing all the nutrients ( including calories, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, etc.).

It can also be used to capture a practitioner's subjective assessment of the patient's risk based on existing knowledge and previous experience. Risk assessments are a specialized type of observation. A specialized resource is used to provide a simpler mechanism to capture of a series of risks and to associate those risks with time-ranges, probabilities, etc. All risk assertions are captured at one time based on a single set of source inputs. Capture of a single risk MAY be done using the Observation class, particularly in circumstances where it's treated as a generic observation, but for consistency, all risk assessments and prognosis SHOULD be captured using RiskAssessment. Risk assessments may be based on a variety of factors, including: Basic demographic information from the Patient or Group resources Various Observations including vital signs, lab information, assessments, genetic information, etc. FamilyMemberHistory Current, past and proposed therapies Immunization, Procedure, CarePlan, etc. Because so many resources can potentially be used, no limit is placed on what resources can be sent in RiskAssessment.basis.

RequestOrchestrations can contain hierarchical groups of actions, where each specific action references the action to be performed (in terms of a Request resource), and each group describes additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall group.", "structure": { "resourceType": "RequestOrchestration", "identifier": [ { "Identifier": {} } ], "instantiatesCanonical": [ "<canonical>" ], "instantiatesUri": [ "<uri>" ], "basedOn": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "replaces": [ { "Reference(Any)": {} } ], "groupIdentifier": { "Identifier": {} }, "status": "<code>", "intent": "<code>", "priority": "<code>", "code": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "subject": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "encounter": { "Reference(Encounter)": {} }, "authoredOn": "<dateTime>", "author": { "Reference(Device|Practitioner|PractitionerRole)": {} }, "reason": [ { "CodeableReference(Condition|DiagnosticReport|DocumentReference|Observation)": {} } ], "goal": [ { "Reference(Goal)": {} } ], "note": [ { "Annotation": {} } ], "action": [ { "linkId": "<string>", "prefix": "<string>", "title": "<string>", "description": "<markdown>", "textEquivalent": "<markdown>", "priority": "<code>", "code": [ { "CodeableConcept": {} } ], "documentation": [ { "RelatedArtifact": {} } ], "goal": [ { "Reference(Goal)": {} } ], "condition": [ { "kind": "<code>", "expression": { "Expression": {} } } ], "input": [ { "title": "<string>", "requirement": { "DataRequirement": {} }, "relatedData": "<id>" } ], "output": [ { "title": "<string>", "requirement": { "DataRequirement": {} }, "relatedData": "<string>" } ], "relatedAction": [ { "targetId": "<id>", "relationship": "<code>", "endRelationship": "<code>", "offsetDuration": { "Duration": {} }, "offsetRange": { "Range": {} } } ], "timingDateTime": "<dateTime>", "timingAge": { "Age": {} }, "timingPeriod": { "Period": {} }, "timingDuration": { "Duration": {} }, "timingRange": { "Range": {} }, "timingTiming": { "Timing": {} }, "location": { "CodeableReference(Location)": {} }, "participant": [ { "type": "<code>", "typeCanonical": "<canonical(CapabilityStatement)>", "typeReference": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|DeviceDefinition|Endpoint|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} }, "role": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "function": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "actorCanonical": "<canonical(CapabilityStatement)>", "actorReference": { "Reference(CareTeam|Device|DeviceDefinition|Endpoint|Group|HealthcareService|Location|Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson)": {} } } ], "type": { "CodeableConcept": {} }, "groupingBehavior": "<code>", "selectionBehavior": "<code>", "requiredBehavior": "<code>", "precheckBehavior": "<code>", "cardinalityBehavior": "<code>", "resource": { "Reference(Any)": {} }, "definitionCanonical": "<canonical(ActivityDefinition|ObservationDefinition|PlanDefinition|Questionnaire|SpecimenDefinition)>", "definitionUri": "<uri>", "transform": "<canonical(StructureMap)>", "dynamicValue": [ { "path": "<string>", "expression": { "Expression": {} } } ], "action": [ { "Content as for RequestOrchestration.action": {} } ] } ] } }
