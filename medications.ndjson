{"resource": "MedicationDispense", "description": "The MedicationDispense resource in the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard encompasses all activities related to the supply of medications to a patient. This includes a variety of scenarios such as dispensing medications for pick-up from an outpatient or community pharmacy, providing patient-specific medications from an inpatient pharmacy to a hospital ward, and issuing a single dose from ward stock directly to a patient for immediate consumption. The process of medication dispensing is typically initiated by a medication order, which a pharmacy system responds to by preparing and providing the prescribed medication to the patient. The MedicationDispense resource tracks the act of dispensing, ensuring that there is a clear record of the supply process, which includes the details of what medication was supplied, to whom, by whom, when, and in what quantity. This resource helps in maintaining an accurate history of medication provided to a patient, which is crucial for patient safety, continuity of care, and proper medication management. The objectives of the MedicationDispense resource are multi-faceted: Ensure Accurate Medication Supply: It ensures that the correct medication is supplied to the right patient in the appropriate dosage and quantity, thereby supporting the safe administration of medications. Facilitate Medication Tracking: It provides a comprehensive record that helps healthcare providers track the dispensing of medications over time, ensuring adherence to prescribed treatment plans and enabling the monitoring of medication usage. Support Clinical Decision-Making: By maintaining a detailed history of medication dispenses, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions regarding future treatment plans and adjustments to ongoing therapies. Enhance Communication and Coordination: The resource improves communication and coordination among various stakeholders, including pharmacists, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers, by providing a transparent and accessible record of medication dispenses. Comply with Regulations: It helps healthcare organizations comply with regulatory requirements related to medication dispensing, ensuring that all necessary documentation and reporting standards are met. Examples of the MedicationDispense resource in action include: A patient visiting an outpatient pharmacy to collect their prescribed medication. A nurse in a hospital ward receiving patient-specific medications from the inpatient pharmacy to administer to their patients. A healthcare provider issuing a single dose of medication from the ward’s stock to a patient for immediate use.

{"resource": "MedicationStatement","description": "Common usage includes:\n\nthe recording of non-prescription and/or recreational drugsthe recording of an intake medication list upon admission to hospitalthe summarization of a patient's 'active medications' in a patient profileA MedicationStatement SHALL NOT be used to record substance abuse or the use of other agents such as tobacco or alcohol UNLESS those agents have been prescribed, e.g. nicotine patches or gum, long term care alcohol, etc. These should recorded as Social History Observations.\n\nThis resource does not produce a medication list, but it does produce individual medication statements that may be used in the List resource to construct various types of medication lists. Note that other medication lists can also be constructed from the other Pharmacy resources (e.g., MedicationRequest, MedicationAdministration).\n\nA medication statement is not a part of the prescribe -> dispense -> administer sequence, but is a report by a patient, significant other or a clinician that one or more of the prescribe, dispense or administer actions has occurred, resulting is a belief that the patient is, has, or will be using a particular medication.\n\nMedicationStatement includes an adherence element. Note that this adherence is specific to that instance of MedicationStatement. If MedicationStatement.adherence is being tracked over time, then instances of MedicationStatement would report adherence for the interval noted in effectivePeriod. The MedicationStatement resource is used to record a medications or substances that the patient reports as being taken, not taking, have taken in the past or may take in the future. It can also be used to record medication use that is derived from other records such as a MedicationRequest. The statement is not used to request or order a medication, supply or device. When requesting medication, supplies or devices when there is a patient focus or instructions regarding their use, a MedicationRequest, SupplyRequest or DeviceRequest should be used instead. This resource is distinct from MedicationRequest, MedicationDispense and MedicationAdministration. Each of those resources refers to specific events - an individual order, an individual provisioning of medication or an individual dosing. MedicationStatement is a broader assertion covering a wider timespan and is independent of specific events. The existence of resource instances of any of the preceding three types may be used to infer a medication statement. However, medication statements can also be captured on the basis of other information, including an assertion by the patient or a care-giver, the results of a lab test, etc.\n\nTo indicate the link between a MedicationStatement instance and the Medication Request, Dispense, or Administration that was used to derive the MedicationStatement, the reference should be placed in the MedicationStatement.derivedFrom element.","structure": {"resourceType": "MedicationStatement","identifier": [{"Identifier": {}}],"partOf": [{"Reference": "MedicationStatement|Procedure"}],"status": "<code>","category": [{"CodeableConcept": {}}],"medication": {"CodeableReference": "Medication"},"subject": {"Reference": "Group|Patient"},"encounter": {"Reference": "Encounter"},"effective[x]": {"effectiveDateTime": "<dateTime>","effectivePeriod": {"Period": {}},"effectiveTiming": {"Timing": {}}},"dateAsserted": "<dateTime>","informationSource": [{"Reference": "Organization|Patient|Practitioner|PractitionerRole|RelatedPerson"}],"derivedFrom": [{"Reference": "Any"}],"reason": [{"CodeableReference": "Condition|DiagnosticReport|Observation"}],"note": [{"Annotation": {}}],"relatedClinicalInformation": [{"Reference": "Condition|Observation"}],"renderedDosageInstruction": "<markdown>","dosage": [{"Dosage": {}}],"adherence": {"code": {"CodeableConcept": {}},"reason": {"CodeableConcept": {}}}}}
